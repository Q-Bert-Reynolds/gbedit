General

- move all strings to separate (generated) file
- link cable support!
- give math subroutines more appropriate names
- math_Divide24 and str_Number24 are both really similar to their 16 bit counterparts, perhaps they can be reduced in to a smaller number of instructions, or we could only use the 24 bit versions
- SetSpriteTiles and SetSpriteTilesProps can likely be merged
- big list of "real names" to use in place of ID and OT

Python scripts

- duplicate functionality (like the PascalCase function) should be moved to library file
- avatar directional maps should be organized into arrays
- only update .asm file when PNG or TMX files change
- handle 1bpp and rle images
- identify animations - same size, numbered names (name0, name1, etc)
- roledex description parser should print warning when more than 6 lines
