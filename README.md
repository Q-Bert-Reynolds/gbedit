# From the back of the box:
You've finally been granted your Béisbol coach's license. Now, it's time to head out to become the world's greatest baseball coach. It's going to take all you've got to recruit 150 Players in this enormous world. Recruit and train Players like the shockingly-cute Chu. Face off against Yogi's torrential cannons. Stand strong when facing OT's stormy Gust. Trade with friends and watch your Players grow. Important - no single Player can win it all. Can you develop the ultimate Béisbol strategy to defeat the eight League Leaders and become the greatest Béisbol Team of all time?

- Recruit up to 139 different Players playing the Home version. Using the Game Link cable (sold separately), trade with a friend who has the Away version to recruit all 150.
- You'll need to use both versions (Home and Away) to recruit all of the Players.
- Test your coaching skills by playing against a friend using the Game Link cable (sold separately).
- Save your Team and game progress on the Game Pak memory.
- Requires basic reading skills to fully enjoy the entertaining story.
