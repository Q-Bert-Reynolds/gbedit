TODO:

- .sav file should be a .txt file
  - should span as many RAM banks as possible
  - should have max line size of 1024
- insert instead of override
- add on-screen kb (in palce of debug info)
  - auto hide on-screen kb when external kb recognized
  - when kb visible, DPad selects kb keys
    - A button selects presses key
    - B button is backspace key
  - when kb hidden, DPad moves cursor
    - holding select should highlight characters
      - could be a second character set for DMG, but HBlank would be cooler
      - highlighting on GBC should be a simple palette change
- word-wrap should be optional
